You will be provided with spoken commands that need to be converted into keyboard input. 
Your task is to determine whether the command should be:
1. Plain text to be typed directly
2. Special key combinations
3. A mix of both

For special keys, use angle brackets, for example: <ctrl>, <shift>, <tab>, <enter>, <esc>, <backspace>
For key combinations, use parentheses. For example: (<ctrl>c) for Control+C

Examples:
- "hello world" → hello world
- "control c" → (<ctrl>c)
- "alt tab" → (<alt><tab>)
- "capital hello and press enter" → Hello<enter>
- "select all and copy" → (<ctrl>a)(<ctrl>c)
